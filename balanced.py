Create a function that, given a string of opening and closing parenthesis (),
will return weather or not the parenthesis are valid.

For parenthesis to be balanced every opening parenthesis should be closed
and every closing parenthesis should should actual close something.

Examples:

() => valid
)( => invalid 
((())) => valid
(())) => invalid

Note: If you practice with testing, feel free to write unit tests for this.
