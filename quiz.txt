A customer has asked you to create a program that will allow them to take custom quizzes.
A quizzes needs to be read in from a csv file. If the file does not exist, 
nothing is read in but the program should not crash.
A quiz consists of a series of questions.
Each question consist of 4 options (A-D), a correct answer, and a difficult score.

Create a program that, given a csv file of questions, will create a quiz.
Once the quiz is created, the user should be prompted with the questions on the command line.
Questions should be asked in difficultly order (from least difficult to most difficult).
Feedback should be given to the user about the accuracy of their answers.
Once they quiz is complete, the program ends. 

You are free to add any methods you feel would make this problem easier, even if they are not mentioned
in the problem statement.
