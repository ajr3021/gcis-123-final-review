You have been asked to implement a virtual card collection game.
A card consist of several key components: a unique name, a description,
and a value.

These cards are then stored in card collections. Card collections automatically
remove duplicate cards. Every card in a collection should be unique.

The goal of the game is to collect as many unique cards as possible.

Your program should be able to do several different things:
1. Create cards and add them a card collection
2. Search for cards in the collection by name
3. Sort cards collections.
    3.1 The more cards that are in the collect, the more valuable it is (therefore it should have a higher score)
    3.2 If two collections have the same number of cards, the collection with higher total value is more valuable
